## Getting Started

### Downloads
To run the code, make sure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd fitcheck-frontend
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal with the Expo Go app on your phone, or press `a` in the terminal to open it in an Android simulator or `i` for iOS (if you have the necessary setup).

### Styling with NativeWind

FitCheck uses NativeWind for utility-first styling with Tailwind-like classes. You can refer to [NativeWind Documentation](https://www.nativewind.dev/) for more details on how to use utility classes in your React Native components.

### Testing the Application

Run the application on your phone or simulator using the Expo CLI (`npm start`).
Use Hot Reloading to instantly see changes on your device or emulator as you modify the code.
To test your app on a real device, scan the QR code from the terminal using the Expo Go app.

### Postman Collection (Backend API)

To test the backend endpoints for FitCheck, use the [Postman Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/f00d6f2af7d5c1e0a5a5).
